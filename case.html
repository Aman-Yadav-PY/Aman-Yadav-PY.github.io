			<h1>India Case</h1>
			<img src="images\pg7.jpg">
			<p>India’s population growth is a concerning issue. The current population growth rate being 1%, implies India will be adding over 13 million people in the current year. The life expectancy is 69.42 years, and the death rate is 7.3 per thousand.
<br>
Although the fertility rate has been falling in India, yet the birth rate is much higher than the death rate compared to other countries.
<br>
India’s current population estimated to be 1.412 billion people being almost 17.7% of the world’s population. We are nearing China whose population is 1.426 billion and has 18.47% of the global population. “India is expected to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation by 2024 and is expected to reach a total population of 1.5 billion by 2030 and 1.66 billion by 2050 way ahead of China’s 1.317 billion people by the middle of the century. Currently, both countries account for nearly 40% of the global population.”, the UN said.
<br>
The UN’s World Population Prospects, 2022 report revealed, the world’s two most populous regions in 2022 are Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, with 2.3 billion people, representing 29% of the global population, and Central and Southern Asia, with 2.1 billion, representing 26% of the total world population. The report a
so added that it is estimated that ten countries experienced a net outflow of more than 1 million migrants between 2010 and 2021.In many of these countries, these outflows were due to temporary labour movements, such as for Pakistan (net outflow of -16.5 million during 2010-2021), India (-3.5 million), Bangladesh (-2.9 million), Nepal (-1.6 million) and Sri Lanka (-1 million).

For India, it’s more challenging with a large population, prevalent job crisis and climate change directly affecting its limited resources. Poor livelihood has encouraged the country’s poor and illiterate population reproducing at a higher rate than their middle- and high-income counterparts, to have more earning hands until they realise it backfires in the long run. Simultaneously, due to climate change resulting in weather extremes, around the globe, there is an increase in Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs). Naturally, the term climate refugees has gained traction.
<br>
India home to 18% of the global population has only 4 percent of its water resources. According to an IMF research, India had nearly eradicated extreme poverty by 2020-21 when food subsidies are considered in. However, the per capita nutrition supply in India is among the lowest in the world. India has more than halved its number of severely poor individuals, according to a World Bank working paper issued in the month of April 2022. The Union government has initiated many schemes over the past few years to alleviate poverty, food crisis, joblessness and these schemes have been successful to some extent in mitigating many societal, economic, and agricultural issues. Yet, the upward pace of population growth continues to counterbalance initiatives employed to achieve these sustainable development goals. Moreover, in case of an adverse dependency ratio between older generations and young people meaning having fewer young people and more older people, along with less social and financial security in India especially for the aged, will lead to new problems. Further, if the young people are jobless and if their skills are not developed, it will lead to a demographic disaster.
<br>
Large population will further burden the natural resources. GDP of the poor which is an estimate of forest, water, soil, and other natural resources etc. being the main source of sustenance for the poor, is depreciating because of overuse. The outbreak of pandemic in early 2020 elevated the poverty levels in India. It is estimated that 150-199 million additional people will fall into poverty by the end of 2022. According to a CMIE report, around 7 million jobs were lost in a year. The demand and supply dynamics changed, with reduction in consumption expenses to control financial outflows. The Indian economy also has one of the largest rates of child poverty. According to Niti Aayog, 25% of the Population in India are poor. In the Global MPI 2021 ranking, India is at 66 out of 109 other countries.
<br>
However, India is no longer the country with the most extreme poverty, states the Brookings report. In the global poverty ranking, India is sliding down. Indian government’s spending on rural welfare schemes contributed greatly to reduce national poverty. By 2030, the government aims to eradicate extreme poverty across the country, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day. In the early post-Independence years, family planning was the main thrust of India’s domestic policy being the first country in the world to have a government family planning programme. However, with time the Indian government’s approach from encouraging contraceptive measures changed towards enhancing reproductive health and empowering women and families. Well, this initiative was only suitable for educated families who understand why this was necessary.
<br>
Education levels contribute significantly in implementing the right mindset; southern states where literacy levels were good, the population remained stable, on the contrary the “Bimaru” northern states with their low educational levels witnessed their populations rising exponentially.
<br>
Moreover, India does not have a national child policy today.
<br>
CM Yogi Adityanath has taken an initiative in this regard by unveiling a new population policy for Uttar Pradesh, which, with more than 166 million people, qualifies of being India’s most populous state. If any state needs a population policy, it is UP and Bihar, the most populous and backward states. The proposal promotes a two-child policy and aims to increase the accessibility of contraceptive measures. People who violate it will be restricted from contesting in local body elections, applying for government jobs or receiving government subsidies. Measures for digital tracking of new-borns, adolescents and senior citizens shall be employed. Improved care of the elderly, along with providing quality education, health and nutrition are promised by the government. But how far these promises will be made successful is yet to be seen. Providing quality education and increasing the marriage age will help limit the number of children in a family. The southern states have set the example. Six states – UP, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh -have roughly 40% of India’s population and fertility rates higher than the replacement level of 2.1. However, as wisdom is not immediately appreciated, as such the states successful in stabilizing their population will be rewarded with fewer parliament seats.
<br>
India needs some serious measures to control the population. Though there is reduction in the no. of children than before, the growth curve has yet to flatten. Incentives, disincentives, education and awareness are the best ways to control the population.</p>

				National Population Policy
		</h1>
		<img style="width:50vw;position: relative;left: 20vw;" src="images\pg9.jpg">
			<p>
				National Population Policy formulated in the year 2000, reaffirms the Government’s commitment towards voluntary and informed choice, target free approach and achievement of replacement level of fertility by simultaneously addressing the issues of contraception, maternal health and child survival.

				The National Family Planning Programme of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is guided by the tenets of the National Population Policy 2000 and oversees its implementation. Under this program the service delivery data is triangulated and further the program is regularly reviewed through annual review meetings, supportive supervision visits, common review missions etc.                                                             
				<br><br>
 				As a result of the Government’s efforts, the successes achieved are enumerated below:
 					<br>
 
 					<ul>
 						<li>The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined from 2.9 in 2005 to 2.2 in 2017 (SRS).</li>
				<li>25 out of 37 States/UTs have already achieved replacement level fertility of 2.1 or less.</li>
				<li>The Decadal growth rate has declined from 21.54% in 1999-2000 to 17.64 % during  2001-11.</li>
				<li>The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) has declined from 23.8 to 20.2 from 2005 to 2017 (SRS).</li>
				<li>The Teenage birth rate has halved from 16 % (NFHS III) to 8 % (NFHS IV).</li>

			<h1>China Case</h1>
			<img src="images\pg5.jpeg">
			<p>
				China's population has fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the national birth rate hitting a record low - 6.77 births per 1,000 people.The population in 2022 - 1.4118 billion - fell by 850,000 from 2021.
					<br>
China's birth rate has been declining for years, prompting a slew of policies to try to slow the trend.
But seven years after scrapping the one-child policy, it has entered what one official described as an "era of negative population growth".
		<br>
The birth rate in 2022 was also down from 7.52 in 2021, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the figures on Tuesday.
<br>
In comparison, in 2021, the United States recorded 11.06 births per 1,000 people, and the United Kingdom, 10.08 births. The birth rate for the same year in India, which is poised to overtake China as the world's most populous country, was 16.42.
<br>
Deaths also outnumbered births for the first time last year in China. The country logged its highest death rate since 1976 - 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, up from 7.18 the previous year.
<br>
Earlier government data had heralded a demographic crisis, which would in the long run shrink China's labour force and increase the burden on healthcare and other social security costs.
<br>
Results from a once-a-decade census announced in 2021 showed China's population growing at its slowest pace in decades. Populations are also shrinking and ageing in other East Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea.
<br>
"This trend is going to continue and perhaps worsen after Covid," says Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ms Su is among experts who expect China's population to shrink further through 2023.
<br>
"The high youth unemployment rate and weaknesses in income expectations could delay marriage and childbirth plans further, dragging down the number of newborns," she added.
<br>
And the death rate in 2023 is likely to be higher than it was pre-pandemic due to Covid infections, she said. China has seen a surge of cases since it abandoned its zero-Covid policy last month.
<br>
China's population trends over the years have been largely shaped by the controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs. In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy had also led to forced abortions and a reportedly skewed gender ratio from the 1980s.
<br>
The policy was scrapped in 2016 and married couples were allowed to have two children. In recent years, the Chinese government also offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare, among other incentives, to reverse, or at least slow, the falling birth rate.
<br>
But these policies did not lead to a sustained increase in the births. Some experts say this is because policies that encouraged childbirth were not accompanied by efforts to ease the burden of childcare, such as more help for working mothers or access to education.
<br>
In October 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping made boosting birth rates a priority. Mr Xi said in a once-in-five-year Communist Party Congress in Beijing that his government would "pursue a proactive national strategy" in response to the country's ageing population.
<br>
Apart from dishing out incentives to have children, China should also improve gender equality in households and workplaces, said Bussarawan Teerawichitchainan, director of the National University of Singapore's Centre for Family and Population Research.
<br>
BBC Future: Are there too many people?
Scandinavian countries have shown that such moves can improve fertility rates, she added.
<br>
According to Paul Cheung, Singapore's former chief statistician, China has "plenty of manpower" and "a lot of lead time" to manage the demographic challenge.

"They are not in a doomsday scenario right away," he said.
<br>
Observers also say merely raising birth rates will not resolve the problems behind China's slowing growth.
<br>
"Boosting fertility is not going to improve productivity or increase domestic consumption in the medium term," said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a public policy professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

			<h1>Japan Case</h1>
			<img style="width:60vw;position:relative;left:18vw;" src="images\pg6.gif">
			<p>
				Last year Japan’s population declined by 300, 000, to 126 million, and and its population is predicted to decline to 87 million by 2040.

				Japan also has an ‘ageing population’ – it is already one of the world’s oldest nations, which a median age of 46, and its predicted that by 2040 there will be three senior citizens for every child under 15, the opposite of the situation in 1975.

				This is an interesting case study relevant to the ‘ageing population‘ topic within A-level sociology’s families and household’s option (AQA 7192/2).

				<strong>Why is this happening?</strong>
Excluding Monaco, Japan has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world – 83.7, and a very low fertility rate of 1.45. However, these figures are not too dissimilar from some European countries, so what really explains Japan’s declining population is it low immigration rate – only 1.8% of Japanese are foreign, compared to 8.6% in the UK for example!

<strong>What will the consequences be:</strong>
Nicholas Eberstadt argues that we already seeing some of the consequences:
<ul>
<li>Labour shortages, especially in care work, hospitality, construction and agriculture.</li>
<li>400 school closures a year.</li>

<li>The emergence of ‘ghost towns’ as the population decreases</li>
<li>Increased burden on elderly welfare – by 2060 36% of its population will be 65 or older.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Why is the Fertility Rate so Low?</strong>
It’s basically a combination of two factors:
<ul>
<li>Economic problems – 50% of the population are in precarious jobs, and economic insecurity is a key reason for not having children. Also, if couples were in a position to have children childcare is too expensive for both partners to remain in work, so this may scupper the desires of even those in permanent jobs!</li>
<li>Traditional gender values remain intact – Japan is the 114th most gender unequal country in the world – traditional and patriarchal values remain in-tact – women don’t want children out of wedlock or with men with no economic prospects – which is about half of all men in Japan!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Why is Migration so Low?</strong>
Japan is geographically remote and culturally homogeneous. Japan has long discouraged immigration – they see it as a threat to Japans’s culture and low crime rate – in fact they point to migration across Europe as an example of its negative impacts.

How is the government going to tackle the crisis?

There are a range of measures…

<ul>
<li>Government sponsored ‘speed dating’ services.</li>
<li>By providing longer maternity leave and childcare</li>
<li>To offset the shrinking labour force through a ‘robot revolution’.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Is there an Upside?</strong>
Well, there’s more land per head, and because Japan is the first to transition into what will likely become a global trend, it’s an opportunity for it to become a world leader in technologies that can assist an ageing population.
